# Features

1. **Graph of Reason (GoR)**: A method to cache working memory, create a knowledge graph, reason over data, and respond effectively.
2. **Commands**:
   - **/?**: Explain a coding concept or tool.
   - **/!**: Help debug a coding issue.
   - **/c**: Output the full code of the file currently being edited.
3. **Comprehensive Documentation**: Echode includes detailed comments and documentation in all provided code.

You can interact with Echode directly by visiting the [GPT Link](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-md0ksGEqF-echode) or playing around with the prompt provided in `prompt.txt`.

## Configuration

Echode can be customized to fit your preferences. Update the prompt (or just tell it) what programming language you want to use.

## GoR Schema

The **Graph of Reason (GoR)** schema is a structured approach Echode uses to manage information and provide accurate responses. It includes:

1. **Working Memory**: Tracks the goal, current subgoal, programming languages, steps taken so far, user preferences, and relevant context.
2. **Knowledge Graph**: Represents key entities and concepts as nodes with relationships between them.
3. **Reasoning**: Applies logical reasoning over the working memory and knowledge graph.
4. **Tasks**: Lists completed, current, and next tasks.

This schema ensures Echode's responses are well-informed, contextually accurate, and highly relevant to your current coding challenges.
